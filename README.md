# A very interesting tokiponedo

### (!) First things, the point of this is to see if you could use toki pona's simplicity as a base for a language that could evolve into an auxlang.

This tokiponedo is an analytic, moderately agglutinative and action-oriented language with verbs functioning simultaneously as adjectives. It is a tokiponedo at heart, and most of its vocabulary is derived from Toki Pona's. It doesn't just include `pu pi toki pona` dictionary, but also words commonly used by the community.

I want to give credit to jan Juli (kili pan Juli). A great inspiration for the structure of this document was the short tutorial `nasin toki: mi toki pona` at https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki. If you want to learn toki pona, or compare this tokiponedo to toki pona. I highly suggest using their document.

## Lexicon (131 in total; 29 verbs and 102 nouns)
Remember(!) that all nouns are transient. Meaning, they can also function as adjectives.

## The Vowel System
This tokiponedo has five vowels, each with a distinct pronunciation:
|  Vowels | IPA Representation |
|---------|--------------------|
| **a**   | /a/                |
| **e**   | /e~ɛ/ **\***       |
| **i**   | /i/                |
| **o**   | /o/                |
| **u**   | /u/                |
#### *: It really depends on your pronounciation, but any form of an "eh" is acceptable as long as it doesn't deviate too much from what's prescribed. If the language's pronounciation does eventually change, this list will change too.
And the consonants are:
| Consonants | IPA Representation |
|------------|--------------------|
| **p**      | /p/                |
| **w**      | /w/                |
| **j**      | /j/                |
| **t**      | /t/                |
| **s**      | /s/                |
| **k**      | /k/                |
| **r**      | /ɾ/                |
## Syllables
Every syllable's structure is `(c)v(n)`. Where `(c)` is an optional consonant, `v` is a vowel. And `(n)` is an optional coda(an `n`) that can be included at the end. While technically vowel(sequences are allowed up to 2), however, they're almost never used. In short, vowel clusters *are* possible; but they've never been encountered. However, the following consonant clusters and sequences are forbidden:
- `nm`
- `nn`
- `ji` 
Therefore, the rule is in short: "there can not be any word who's syllable is `ji` or ends with `n` and the next syllable starts with `n` or `m`."
## Pronouns
Singular
- `mi` = "I/mine"
- `si` = "You/yours"
- `nijan `= "He/she/it/him/her"
Plural:
- `mai` = "We"
- `sai` = "you(plural)"
- `awejan` = They/them"
Pronouns can also become *possessive*, but we'll look into that later.
## The Basics of a Sentence
A sentence is composed of a subject and a predicate with some following prepositions. Now, a predicate may contain preverbs.
### the predicate
The **predicate** is the thing is being done are or is,
-   It can be an action; like working, playing, talking
-   or a description; like blue, good, tall
-   or a thing; like house, animal, food
-   and finally:  a verb which applies it's "action" to a certain object.
### the subject
The **subject** is generally the maker, or doer of the predicate. Likewise, the predicate *describes* something about the subject. There is no clear way to understand if something is a name; it is up to the context to specify whether or not someone is a person. We do not say `jan Anjo` like they do in toki pona. `Anjo` is enough.
### Sentence Structure
Now to provide more info on the sentence structure, it's *almost* like toki pona's. a sentence could be: 
`{ [(A|<preposition>|<sentence>|)]* wa B [<preverb><verb>]* o C [kin D]* [<preposition>]* }`. Where,
- `<sentence>` stands for any well-formed sentence here
- `<preverb>` stands for any valid preverb.
- `<preposition>`stands for any valid preposition
- `(X|Y|Z)` stands for "pick either X, Y, or Z"
- The asterisk (`*`) means that an object of the same form as the preceding one may occur any number of times (*including* zero)
## Word Derivations
Base modifiers are also quite easy to convert. When a modifier is used as a noun, it becomes the abstract object of the modifier. Think of it like adding "-ness" to the word, or a quality of thereof to the word.
### Nouns are (plural) Adjectives.
Like we discussed earlier, there is no clear adjective-verb distinction; virtually almost every noun can be used as an adjective. This does not hold true for verbs.  Additionally, all nouns are *both* singular and plural. You either specify, or derive the plurality of a noun from context. They are similar to the english pronoun: `you`.
### Head Initial order
Like the title suggests, this language is head initial. Therefore, your "modifiers" come *after* the head(the main verb). Since all nouns can be adjectives, they can also modify to reference the *quality* of the head. For example in English we can see this with: `speak good` and `good speak`; the former implies that speech itself is/must be good, whereas the latter implies that the *speech* itself is good. If you want to call someone something, you should construct your sentence in a topic-comment structure.
- `jan pona` literally means "person-good". But it can also mean "people-good". Here, the noun `pona` modifies `jan` and it becomes an *adjective* expressing that `jan` has a quality of `pona`. Now the specific use with `jan` here is still sort of ambiguous. As we will see later how `jan` can be used to refer to names or peoples.
### Referring to Names(People, Land)
It is good practice, in general, to refer to names by modifying `jan` with the name you wish for. That way, it is understood that the name refers to a person and not anything else. Similarly, if you want to refer to a place or a "land" you would modify `ma` with the land you want to reference. To understand why this is, look at the following:
- `mi wa wiweru wi tokeru o wiwe mi tawa inkuwanto ni. nijan wa paneru mute kokijari tawa mi.` = "I want to say (of) my gratitude towards this England. He/She gave me a lot of lanterns."
- `mi wa wiweru wi tokeru o wiwe mi tawa jan inkuwanto ni. awijan wa panu o mute mute`
It's obvious, that the first sentence makes no sense. There's no specific understanding of what `inkuwanto` (the general noun to refer to England and the English) is. However, the second clarifies the sentence quite well by explicitly stating that `inkuwanto ni` is a `jan` (person / people).

In toki pona, verbs are also nouns. This isn't really true in this tokiponedo. Instead, we mutate the suffix of a word to "verb"-ify it and "noun"-ify it. 
- To make a verb a noun you simply append `ijo` to the noun.
- To make a noun a Verb you simply append `ru` to the noun.
Appending both does NOT mean that the word now is *both* a verb and a noun. It is always the suffix, that determines what the verb is (noun by `ijo` or verb by `ru`). Additionally, There are some "phono-tactic" rules when we are *mutating* a word.
#### **if we are making a verb a noun**:
1. if the second to last syllable contains an "`e`" it becomes an `a`.
2. if the last syllable is open (no n) then you only add "`jo`".
3. if the last syllable has a final n (coda), you add "`ijo`".
#### **if we are making a noun a verb**:
1. if the second to last syllable contains an "`a`"w it becomes an `e` and append `-ru`
2. if the last syllable starts with consonant `r` or `k`, then you don't append but the vowel of the syllable becomes an "`u`"
3. if the last syllable has a final n (coda), you add "`ijo`".
This way most verbs would end in `ru` or `ju`. you can see this with the following examples:
- `kiwan` is a noun while it's verb form is `kiwenru`.
- `wiwe` is a noun while it's verb form is `wiweru`
#### The irregulars that don't follow the `a -> e` or `e -> a` rule are:
- `awi`
- `tatetajo`
- `rua`
- `wanu`
- `soju`
- `pawi`
This list is non-exhaustive and there may be more irregulars. Usually these consist of loan words, or other borrowed terms.
## Preverbs
Preverbs are used to modify the **verb** that simple modifiers cannot. They usually inform us about the **tense** that the verb is taking place in. They are added *before* the verb you want to modify. Otherwise, they simply express a *quality* of the verb, due to the nature of head-initial order modification. You can chain as many as you'd like, and in this situation, normal head-initial order holds true. 
Most preverbs will mostly consist of `a` sounding syllables. But here's a non exhaustive list.
### The preverb `kama` --- Future Tense.
`kama` indicates that the predicate **will become** true, that it was previously **not** doing.
- `kama paweru o ijo` = "will make the thing" (you were previously not making the thing). 
- `kama konju o ni` = literally "me "arriving/becoming chasing this" = "I **will** be following this".
### The preverb `ruka`--- The Continuous.
`ruka` indicates that the action *is continuing*, that it has been doing. It is analogous to the continuous auxiliary verb "been". `ruka` is almost exclusively placed last of the preverbs, to modify the previous to be "continuous". For instance,
- `ruka paweru o ijo` = "work-(ing) the thing".
- `kama ruka paweru o ijo` = "will be working the thing".
### The preverb `tana` --- Past Tense.
`tana` indicates that the action **had started** to be true, that it was doing in the past.
- `mi wa tana ruka taweru o soweri` = "I had been moving the animal".
### No preverb.
Having no *tense* preverb, means that the action is assumed to be happening once in the present. But it really depends on the context of the phrase. 
## Particles
*Particles* are words that have usually have no meaning, and only or primarily have grammatical functions. Due to our head initial order, they come *after* the word they tend to modify. `taweru o kasi` means move the plant/herb. `o` is a particle we will discuss, and it is placed after `taweru`.
### Marker particles
- `o` denotes the direct object; it is the "direct object" marker. In our previous example(`taweru o kasi`), `o` is placed after `taweru`, indicating that `taweru` acts on `kasi`. Thereby, `kasi` is the **direct object**; the recipient of `taweru`.
- `e` the closest to the **vocative** case. Saying `e X` is equivelant to "hey X!". It can also be used in the place of `wa` to express the **imperative case**; By changing the predicate into a **command**.
- `wa` is the context/relation marker. For instance, `A wa B` means "Because/about/in the context of A, B". Most sentences of ours will be constructed this way. Using `wa` relates whats after it as the main topic of the clause/sentence. For example: `kin wa, mi wa,` would mean something like "additionally, about me". We will look into the use of `kin` more analytically in later chapters.
- `wi` links two verbs.
- `pi` regroups modification such that what's before it, is modified by what's after it. Consider it more of like parenthesis that restructure a phrase such that the head-noun modification happens elsewhere. For example,
`ma sujo ma ikuwanto` = land vegetable  
### Pseudo-Particles
Pseudo particles are words that *can* act like particles, but they're also nouns. For example `nanpa`. Regarding the use of `wa`, there's no direct way to address the subject of a sentence or clause. wa simply adds context to what's being said. Thus, it is a practice to isolate your thoughts as much as possible, or include the subject at the end of a sentence. If you want to address multiple distinct subjects (something that can't be achieved by just using pronouns) consider using the particle `ne`. For example, if you want to say something like `you and I move to the house`:
- `mi wa, sina wa, taweru tawa tomo jo mi` = `Regarding me, (the topic changes to be onto sina) you go to the house (owned by) me` = `About me, you go to my house`. This understandably makes little sense.
- `mi ne sina wa taweru tawa tomo jo mi` = `Regarding you and I, move to the house (owned by) me` = `you and I move to my house`. This makes a lot more sense for our goal.
- `nanpa` is the **ordinal particle**; it is like the `-th` suffix in English. We will go over in detail about this particle in later chapters.
- `taso` expresses **contradiction** and/or exclusivity; marking something as contrary or exclusive to the rest. It can mean `however, but, only` etc.
- `ante` expresses **difference** that's not necessarily a *contradiction*. Using `wa`; `ante wa`, can mean something like "regarding this other" or "in the other hand".
- `kin` expresses *addition** and it is an additive marker; marking something as being in some what contextually significant to the rest. It can mean `also, additionally` etc.
### The pseudo-particle `taso`
The word `taso` can indicate that the marked phrase is the "only" thing that the sentences statement applies to. Sentence initially, it marks the whole sentence as contrary to some previous statement, like English "but". In some contexts, it can even work as a head-noun.
### The pseudo-particle `kin`
`kin` can be appended like a modifier to any phrase, but cannot occur as a head itself. The only exception is in the context-phrase `kin wa`, where it marks the whole following sentence as an addition to what was already said.

#### Examples of different placement:
- `ron tomo ne soweri pi ma sujo wa, kasi wa, nijan taso wa taweru o kasi` = "At the house and the beast of the forest, regarding (a) plant, only he/she/it move the plant."
- `njian wa taweru taso o kasi` = "he/she/it only move the plant."
- `njian kin wa taweru taso o kasi` = `he/she/it *also* move the plant."
- `taso wa, awijan taweru taso o kasi` = "However, only *they(plural)* can move the plant".
- `kin wa, ni wa taweru o kasi` = "Furthermore, this moves the plant".
### Chaining Verbs 
Verb chaining is a linguistic concept where multiple verbs are linked together in a sentence, to express a sequence of actions or to modify the meaning of one another. In this tokiponedo this is done using `wi`. For example
- `taneru wi taweru`  = "originate (to) move."
As meaning roughly after `taneru` the `wi` becomes to mean something like "*in order to*" taweru. Therefore that(`taneru wi taweru`) could be interperted as "originate to move to". Again, the usage of this must be **highly dependent** on the meaning of the verbs. 

Well that didn't really make a lot of sense.. "to originate to move" is nonsensical after all. So, let's look at another example.

Let's attempt to link *to try to*(`paweru`) with *move*(`taweru`), which together would mean "try to move to". For example, 
- `mi wa wiweru wi paweru wi taweru tawa sina` = "I want to try to move towards you". 
#### Importance of context!
This sentence makes a lot more sense and conveys the meaning. Regarding meaning, the aforementioned example literally translates to:  me want (to) try/attempt/struggle (to) move to (towards) you. Here, `wiweru` is used in conjuction with `taweru` to mean "want, in order/to, move". This usage of `wiweru` is analogous to what the optative mood is in other languages, with the exception that there are no true moods here -- but a combination of actions describes the action in detail.

#### The particle `na` 
It is the negation particle and denotes "not". Usually coming after the word it intends to modify(even prepositions can have a `na`). For example in 
-  mi wi ru **na**  o ni. (I am **not** doing that)
#### The particles `ne` and `nu` 
It links subjects and/or objects, **but not verbs**. Functioning like the english `and`. For example,
- `mi ne si wa ruka taweru o tomo` = "me and you are going to the house"
Meanwhile, `anu` functions like `or`, seperating the multiple possibilities.
- `mi anu si wa ruka taweru o tomo` = "me **or** you are going to the house".
- `si wa ron ni anu seme?` = "Are you there or what?".
The use of `anu` is highly appropriate on context, and I can only suggest that you use a context-appropriate "`anu`-phrase". `anu` can only seperate objects or subjects like `ne` does. 
#### The particle `jo` 
`jo` roughly translates to "own, possess, have"; As the *posessive* particle, it means "owned" or "possessed (by)", indicating ownership of what comes before it by what comes after it. Since this tokiponedo is using a head-initial order, `jo` modifies a verb to clarify posession, and then any further modification becomes the *recipient* of the posession. Aka, the "owner". For example,
- `ijo ni jo mi` = "This thing is mine".
- `tomo jo Anjo` = "Anjo's house"
#### The particle `ni` 
It is analogous to "this", "that"; It is the **demonstrative particle**.  Out of all particles discussed, it is important to understand that `ni` is used for various purposes
- as a "that/this/there/those" (`jan ni seme?)` = literally "this man who?" or basically "who is it".
- `jan seme ni` would mean "man-who this?" and while it would still make *some* sense, the demonstrative particle should modify `jan` and **not** `seme`.
- to demonstrate emphasis, like saying "this thing here" (`ijo ni`)
### Questions
`seme` forms questions. you replace the word which you seek inquiry for.
- `nimi si wa seme?` = "your name is what?" = "What is your name?"
- `si wa ru seme?` = "you're doing what?" (**ru is the verb meaning "to do"**)
- `seme wa Anjo` = "what(subject) is Anjo?" = "Who's Anjo?" 
- `jan nimi wa seme?` = "person's name is what?" = "what is their name" ?
Additionally repeating the verb of the sentence in conjuction with `na`(negation particle) forms **yes or no** questions.
- `si wa wiweru wi mokeru na mokeru o kasi?` = "Do you want or not want to eat the fruit" = Do you want to eat the fruit? (while expecting a yes or no as an answer).
- `mama si wa wiweru wi taweru na taweru o si tawa tomo jo Anjo` = "Does your mother want to move you to Anjo's house?"
If we want to talk about if something is true, we can use the particle `ron` which implies existence and position in conjuction with the context marker `wa`:
- `A wa ron na ron B?` = `About A, in exists (not) exists B?` or something like `Does B exist in A` ?
## Recursion
Recursion is a bit tricky; and will be discussed once i update this text. For now I advice simply closing your sentences and using anaphora or the demonstrative particle to refer to something in another sentence. For example, "I will move to the house that has no doors" could be:
- `mi wa taweru o tomo. tomo ni wa ron na poruta`.
The above literally translates to `"I moving to house. about this house, (exist) no doors"`, or `"I will move to this house. about doors, (exist) not this house".` A quick reminder of sentence structure; saying the inverse:
- `mi wa taweru o tomo. poruta wa ron na tomo ni `.
Would mean that there **are** doors or there **is** a door but they don't exist in *this* house. Swapping the subject with the object doesn't result in the same meaning, because the topic now becomes `poruta` and not `tomo ni`. Now let's take a minute and describe how `wa` can also mean "has". By using `wa`, we're simply implying a relationship between the subject and the predicate. The second sentence of the first example(`tomo ni wa ron na poruta`) literally means "in the context of this house, there (exist) no doors".  Of course 'exist' is implied, ron mostly means *present*.
## Prepositions
Prepositions are used to further describe the *manner* of the predicate. They indicate information about where, whither, whence, how, or whereby the predicate is performed.
### The preposition `tawa`
Being a derivative of `taweru`(to move) it describes movement towards a specific object or person. For example,
- `mi wi taweru o ijo tawa si` = "I am moving the thing **towards** you"
- `ijo wi tawa si` = "the thing is moving **towards** you".
- `ijo wi taweru tawa seme` = literally: the thing moving towards what? = "what is it moving towards?".
Notice how, if we were to introduce `o` the meaning would change:
- `ijo wi taweru o seme?` = "it is moving the what?" = "What is it moving?"
- `ijo wi taweru o ni tawa seme` = "it is moving the **this** towards what?".  After all, ni can also refer to "this/that" like we saw.
Remember: This would have a completely different meaning if we said `ijo wi taweru o si`. As that would mean "the thing is moving **you**". This is because `o` marks the direct object(the recipient of the action).
Therefore, the exact meaning of `tawa` depends on its usage.
### The preposition `iwa`
Being a derivative of `iwo`, it describes the usage. It is analogous to saying "using" in English but with a different twist. For the toki-ponists, this is `kepeken`. For instance:
- `awejan taweru o si iwa suko` = "They're moving you using a mushroom".
- `awejan taweru o ijo ni tawa si iwa suko` = "They're moving this thing towards you using a mushroom".
- `awejan taweru iwa seme?` = "What are they moving with?". This question specifically asks which is the method of movement, or roughly the vehicle
### The preposition `tana`
Being a derivative of `tan`, it means to originate from. It it similarly used to the toki pona equivelant `tan`. For instance:
- `awejan wa tana ma inkuwanto` = "they are from (land) england".
### The preposition `ron` 
It roughly translates into "into at". It’s a locative particle that marks *both* space and time. In other words, it can refer to a specific place **in space** or a specific moment **in time**. For example,
- `mi ne si wa ron tomo` = "me and you (are/at) the house." 
- `mi wa ru na ron tenpo ni` = "I'm not doing anything right now"
- `mi wa tokeru o awejan ron tomo` = "I am speaking to them in the house"
Like we discussed earlier, and particularly visible in the first sentence, you do not need to state that the subject(`mi ne si`) "is". `wa` means roughly "in the context of" or "about". Here, it means something more like "about, existing/thus,". Putting it all together the first sentence is more directly translated to: "About me and you, thus existing, on the house". It is a faster way to convey the more general translation that is provided. Another example of how `na` could be used in conjuction with the preposition is:
- `mi wa tokeru o awejan tawa Anjo sama na Koto` = "I am speaking about them to Anjo, in the manner, unlike Koto".
### The preposition `sama` -- A-like B.
`sama` means similarity, and therefore, using it implies that the **predicate** is similar to something. Like we discussed earlier, prepositions describe the *manner* of the predicate. Let's look at an example:
- `Anjo wa tokeru o A ni sama mi` = "Anjo is speaking of (this) A like me.".
- `Anjo wa sama mi` = "Anjo is like me"
In classic toki pona speech, the `wa` wouldn't be put as their equivelant clarifies the verb of the predicate. However, `wa` here is more general: implying the context(sometimes casual sometimes not). If you're familiar with other languages, it is  *sort of* like the topic marker in Japaense; in the sense that it can also imply the subject.
## Expressions and Customs
- `ron naijo` = literally "present in nothing". For instance this can be used to describe actions **in vain**(notice how similar this expression is in english too.)
- `ron tenpo ni` = "present in current time" ("this" time)
- `e jan awi!` = 'hey everyone'.
- `e kameru pona!` = 'welcome!'
- `jari pona` = literally `good day`. It means hello.
- `A sama B` = `A is like B`, where A is the context. Here sama functions as an **adjective** rather than noun. And the sentence most accurately translates to: `me-like B`.
## Enumeration & Counting
#### It is important to remember, that this language **uses** base 12. So, to properly count in this language, you must know base 12.
## Cardinal numbers --- "How many?"
Since any noun can act as an adjective, all numbers can be applied to another noun to express the "quality of". To say something like two women, you would say `mewi tu`. Which roughly translates to "twos of woman". Saying the opposite(`tu mewi`) would *sort of* imply the same meaning, except you would suggest that the two(the number) itself has some quality to the noun woman(`mewi`); which is contradictory so it is preferrable you always add the cardinal noun/adjective at the end.
### The suffix `-ko`
We can simply just stack numbers together: `mewi ko tu` = "women of groups of twelves of twos"; Something like this would mean "fourteen women".
#### Keep in mind, this operation is "additive" not "multiplicative".
While this tokiponedo remains an *analytic* language, `ko` is one of those cases where it is acceptable to add it as a suffix. For instance the word `nana` is the number 9. `nanaku` means 9 groups of twelves; the mathematical operation of 9 **\*** 12. As we can see, when we're making numbers(as nouns), the combination operation becomes *multiplicative*.
So saying, "`there are 94 women`", you would say: `meji wa nanaku wan ron ni` which more accurately translates to `In the context of women, 94 exist at/on here.`.
# Ordinal Numbers -- "Nth of what?"
If you wanted to say "`she is the 94th woman here`", you wouldn't *exactly say* that as the grammar works quite differently. You would say something like `about her, the 94th woman`, **using** the cardinal particle `nanpa`. Thus, our previous example becomes:
- `nijan wa meji nanpa tu ron ni` = "she is the 94th woman here."
**However** `meji wa nanpa tu` is grammatically incorrect since `nanpa` is  used in conjunction(like other particles) with a noun directly related to it. It can not be applied to `wa`, which is itself a marker.
