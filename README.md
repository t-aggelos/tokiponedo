# A very interesting tokiponedo

### (!) First things, the point of this is to see if you could use toki pona's simplicity as a base for a language that could evolve into an auxlang.

We will introduce (and im sorry to say this), the alveolar tapped r which we will denote with r from now on.
We will introduce plural pronouns to make speech less "vague" (we're attacking the core toki pona principle but that's ok)
We will introduce agglutination to make the language less ambiguous.
Do a lot of relexification cause, and it could just be me, toki pona sounds ugly and has lots of l's and i's.

While uncommon, it's technically "possible" to have vowel clusters in words; syllables could end in a vowel and start with another as the permissible
rules allow the syllable structure (c)v(n). I will highlight for the first few words each syllable by separating it with a "-" symbol.


## Lexicon
Remember(!) that all nouns are transient. Meaning, they can also function as adjectives.
#### We will note particles with `(p)`, verbs with `(v)` and nouns with `(n)`, prepositions with `(z)` and preverbs with `(pv)`.
- aru(v) = cast, the direction of light; also means ray.
- konju(v) = follow, chase, go after.
- weku(v) = throw away, to get rid of, to wipe off.
- panu(v) = to give, send, provide.
- wasu(v) = to fly, to soar.
- suju(v) = to grow, flourish, flower.
- ru(v) = to act, to do.
- kiweru(v) = to harden, to toughen.
- awenru(v) = to keep, to protect.
- kameru(v) = to arrive, to approach
- paweru(v) = to work, to struggle (look at preverb `pawa`)
- moku(v) = to consume, to drink.
- taweru(v) = to move, to stride, walk (look at preverb `pawa`)
- jeweru(v) = to corrupt, to decay. 
- poneru(v) = to improve, to "goodify", to make better.
- toku(v) = to speak, to say, to communicate.

## Pronouns
Singular
- `mi` = "I/mine"
- `si` = "You/yours"
- `ona `= "He/she/it/him/her"

Plural:
- `mai` = "We"
- `sai` = "you(plural)"
- `onai` = They/them"

Pronouns can also become *possessive*, but we'll look into that later.

## Preverbs
 Preverbs are a tough nut to crack, they're mostly a toki pona relic. They don't really have any semantic meaning other than they follow the inverse pattern we know: they go before a verb than after it, and transform it.
### The preverb `kama`
`kama` indicates that the predicate **will become** true, that it was previously **not** doing.
"`mi wi kama paweru o ijo`" simply means that you are will start creating the thing, but you were previously not doing. 
- `mi wi kama konju o ni` = literally "me "arriving to chasing this" = "I **will** be following this"
## Particles
*Particles* are words that have usually have no meaning, and only or primarily have grammatical functions.
#### The particle `na` 
It is the negation particle and denotes "not". For example in 
-  mi wi ru **na** o ni. (I am **not** doing that)
#### The particle  `ne` 
It links subjects and objects. For example,
- `mi ne si wi taweru o tomo` = "me and you go to the house"
#### The particle  `ron` 
It roughly translates into "into at". Itâ€™s a locative particle that marks *both* space and time. In other words, it can refer to a specific place **in space** or a specific moment **in time**. For example,
- `mi ne si ron tomo` = "me and you (are/at) the house." 
- `mi wi ru na ron tenpo ni` = "I'm not doing anything right now"
#### The particle `jo` 
It roughly translates to "own, possess, have"; It is the possessive particle, indicating ownership. For example,
- `ijo ni jo mi` = "This thing is mine".
- `tomo jo jan Anjo` = "Anjo's house"
#### The particle `ni` 
It is analogous to "this", "that"; It is the demonstrative particle.  Out of all particles discussed, it is important to understand that `ni` is used for various purposes
- as a "that/this/there/those" (`jan ni wi seme?)` = "who is it".
- to demonstrate emphasis, like saying "this thing here" (`ijo ni`)

### Marker particles
- `o` denotes the direct object; it is the "direct object" marker
- `wi` separates the subject from the predicate
- `wa` context marker.

`wi` makes what's before it the "subject", and what's after it the **predicate**. We do not really have a clear and seperate "subject-object" pattern, but rather, we have a part of the sentence which indicates what the subject **does** or what happens to it. Some sentences may not need this distinction at all, like for instance:
- `ni jo mi` = "this of me" = "this is mine".
- `ni wi jo mi` would mean "this is/has possessiveness **me**" = *it possess me.*

Therefore, You should not think of "`wi`" as is, but as a "logical separator" of the subject from the rest of the sentence. The same logic applies to "`o`". Many sentences may not need **a direct object at all**. Saying `tenpo ni wa mi ne si ron tomo jo mi` = "Right now, me and you are on my house" **requires no** "`o`".
### Questions
`seme` forms questions. you replace the word which you seek inquiry for.
- `nimi si wi seme?` = "your name is what?" = "What is your name?"
- `si wi ru seme?` = "you're doing what?" (**ru is the verb meaning "to do"**)
- `seme wi jan Anjo` = "who is (human) Anjo?" = "Who's Anjo?" 
- `jan seme ni` = "what man this" ?
## Prepositions
Prepositions are used to further describe the *manner* of the predicate. They indicate information about where, whither, whence, how, or whereby the predicate is performed.
### The preposition `tawa`
Being a derivative of `taweru`(to move) it describes movement towards a specific object. For example,
- `mi wi taweru o ijo tawa si` = "I am moving the thing **to** you"
- `ijo wi tawa si` = "the thing is moving **towards** you".
- `ijo wi taweru tawa seme` = literally: the thing moving towards what? = "what is it moving towards?".

Notice how, if we were to introduce `o` the meaning would change:
- `ijo wi taweru o seme?` = "it is moving the what?" = "What is it moving?"
- `ijo wi taweru o ni tawa seme` = "it is moving the **this** towards what?".  After all, ni can also refer to "this/that" like we saw.

Remember: This would have a completely different meaning if we said `ijo wi taweru o si`. As that would mean "the thing is moving **you**". This is because `o` marks the direct object(the recipient of the action).
Therefore, the exact meaning of `tawa` depends on its usage.
### The preposition `iwa`
Being a derivative of `iwo`, it describes the usage. It is analogous to saying "using" in English but with a different twist. For instance:
- `onai wi taweru o si iwa suko` = "They're moving you using a mushroom".
- `onai wi taweru o ijo ni tawa si iwa suko` = "They're moving this thing towards you using a mushroom".
- `onai wi taweru o seme?` = "What are they moving?"
## Sentence Structure
Now to provide more info on the sentence structure, it's *almost* like toki pona's. a sentence could be: 
`{ [(A|<preposition>|<sentence>|)]* wa B wi [<preverb>]* o C [kin D]* [<preposition>]* }`. Where,
- `<sentence>` stands for any well-formed sentence here
- `<preverb>` stands for any valid preverb
- `<preposition>` stands for any valid preposition
- `(X|Y|Z)` stands for "pick either X, Y, or Z"
- The asterisk (`*`) means that an object of the same form as the preceding one may occur any number of times (*including* zero)
# Verbs & Nouns
In toki pona, most verbs are also nouns. This isn't really true in this tokiponedo. Instead, we mutate the suffix of a word to "verb"-ify it and "noun"-ify it. Not **all** nouns can become verbs, such as, `tan` can not become a verb. Why? because what would be the direct object of tan? You can not "originate" something, you can only originate *from* something. Now it "could" mean create. However, if you mean to "create" something, you can always use simpler **more conventional** words to mean the same thing.
- To make a verb a noun you simply append `ijo` to the noun.
- To make a noun a Verb you simply append `ru` to the noun.
#### Appending both does NOT mean that the word now is *both* a verb and a noun. It is always the suffix, that determines what the verb is (noun by `ijo` or verb by `ru`).
Additionally, There are some "phono-tactic" rules when we are *mutating* a word.
**if we are making a verb a noun**:
1. if the second to last syllable contains an "`e`" it becomes an `a`.
2. if the last syllable is open (no n) then you only add "`jo`".
3. if the last syllable has a final n (coda), you add "`ijo`".

**if we are making a noun a verb**:

1. if the second to last syllable contains an "`a`" it becomes an `e`.
2. if the last syllable starts with `ra`, then the vowel of the syllable becomes an "`u`"
3. if the last syllable's consonant isn't j or r, you append "`-ru`"

This way most verbs would end in `ru` or `ju`. you can see this with the following examples:
- `weku` is a verb while it's noun form is `waka`.
- `kiwan` is a noun while it's verb form is `kiwenru`.

## The irregulars that don't follow the `a -> e` or `e -> a` rule are
- `awen`
- `weka`

This list is non-exhaustive and there may be more irregulars!
