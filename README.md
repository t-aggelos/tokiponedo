# A very interesting tokiponedo

### (!) First things, the point of this is to see if you could use toki pona's simplicity as a base for a language that could evolve into an auxlang.

We will introduce (and im sorry to say this), the alveolar tapped r which we will denote with r from now on.
We will introduce plural pronouns to make speech less "vague" (we're attacking the core toki pona principle but that's ok)
We will introduce agglutination to make the language less ambiguous.
Do a lot of relexification cause, and it could just be me, toki pona sounds ugly and has lots of l's and i's.

While uncommon, it's technically "possible" to have vowel clusters in words; syllables could end in a vowel and start with another as the permissible
rules allow the syllable structure (c)v(n). I will highlight for the first few words each syllable by separating it with a "-" symbol.

Lastly, I want to give credit to jan Juli (kili pan Juli). A great inspiration for the structure of this document was the short tutorial `nasin toki: mi toki pona` at https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki. If you want to learn toki pona, or compare this tokiponedo to toki pona. I highly suggest using their document.

## Pronouns
Singular
- `mi` = "I/mine"
- `si` = "You/yours"
- `nijan `= "He/she/it/him/her"

Plural:
- `mai` = "We"
- `sai` = "you(plural)"
- `awejan` = They/them"

Pronouns can also become *possessive*, but we'll look into that later.
## The Basics of a Sentence
A sentence is composed of a subject and a predicate with some following prepositions. Now, a predicate may contain preverbs.
### the predicate
The **predicate** is the thing is being done are or is,
-   It can be an action; like working, playing, talking
-   or a description; like blue, good, tall
-   or a thing; like house, animal, food
-   and finally:  a verb which applies it's "action" to a certain object.
#### the subject
The **subject** is generally the maker, or doer of the predicate. Likewise, the predicate *describes* something about the subject. There is no clear way to understand if something is a name; it is up to the context to specify whether or not someone is a person. We do not say `jan Anjo` like they do in toki pona. `Anjo` is enough.
### Verbs are Adjectives.
There is no clear adjective-verb distinction, virtually almost every noun can be used as an adjective. This does not hold true for verb. If you want to call someone something, you should construct your sentence in a topic-comment structure.
## Sentence Structure
Now to provide more info on the sentence structure, it's *almost* like toki pona's. a sentence could be: 
`{ [(A|<preposition>|<sentence>|)]* wa B [<preverb><verb>]* o C [kin D]* [<preposition>]* }`. Where,
- `<sentence>` stands for any well-formed sentence here
- `<preverb>` stands for any valid preverb.
- `<preposition>`stands for any valid preposition
- `(X|Y|Z)` stands for "pick either X, Y, or Z"
- The asterisk (`*`) means that an object of the same form as the preceding one may occur any number of times (*including* zero)
## Verbs & Nouns
In toki pona, most verbs are also nouns. This isn't really true in this tokiponedo. Instead, we mutate the suffix of a word to "verb"-ify it and "noun"-ify it. 
- To make a verb a noun you simply append `ijo` to the noun.
- To make a noun a Verb you simply append `ru` to the noun.

Appending both does NOT mean that the word now is *both* a verb and a noun. It is always the suffix, that determines what the verb is (noun by `ijo` or verb by `ru`). Additionally, There are some "phono-tactic" rules when we are *mutating* a word.
### **if we are making a verb a noun**:
1. if the second to last syllable contains an "`e`" it becomes an `a`.
2. if the last syllable is open (no n) then you only add "`jo`".
3. if the last syllable has a final n (coda), you add "`ijo`".

### **if we are making a noun a verb**:

1. if the second to last syllable contains an "`a`" it becomes an `e` and append `-ru`
2. if the last syllable starts with consonant `r` or `k`, then you don't append but the vowel of the syllable becomes an "`u`"
3. if the last syllable has a final n (coda), you add "`ijo`".

This way most verbs would end in `ru` or `ju`. you can see this with the following examples:
- `weku` is a verb while it's noun form is `waka`.
- `kiwan` is a noun while it's verb form is `kiwenru`.

## The irregulars that don't follow the `a -> e` or `e -> a` rule are
This list is non-exhaustive and there may be more irregulars. Usually these consist of loan words, or other borrowed terms.
- `awen`
- `tatetajo`

## Preverbs
Preverbs are used to modify the **verb** that simple modifiers cannot. They usually inform us about the **tense** that the verb is taking palce in. Also, they are added *before* the predicate they are applied to; however you can chain as many as you'd like, and in this situation, normal head-initial order holds true. 
Most preverbs will mostly consist of `a` sounding syllables. But here's a non exhaustive list.
### The preverb `kama` --- Future Tense.
`kama` indicates that the predicate **will become** true, that it was previously **not** doing.
- `kama paweru o ijo` = "will make the thing" (you were previously not making the thing). 
- `kama konju o ni` = literally "me "arriving/becoming chasing this" = "I **will** be following this".
### The preverb `ruka`--- The Continuous.
`ruka` indicates that the predicate *is continuing*, that it has been doing. It is analogous to the continuous auxiliary verb "been". `ruka` is almost exclusively placed last of the preverbs, to modify the previous to be "continuous". For instance,
- `ruka paweru o ijo` = "work-(ing) the thing".
- `kama ruka paweru o ijo` = "will be working the thing".
### The preverb `tana` --- Past Tense.
`tana` indicates that the predicate **had started** to be true, that it was doing in the past.
- `mi wa tana ruka taweru o soweri` = "I had been moving the animal".
### No preverb.
Having no *tense* preverb, means that the action is assumed to be happening once in the present. But it really depends on the context of the phrase. 
## Particles
*Particles* are words that have usually have no meaning, and only or primarily have grammatical functions. Due to our head initial order, they come *before* the word they tend to modify. `taweru o kasi` means move the plant/herb. `o` is a particle we will discuss, and it is placed before `kasi`. However, as we will see, depending on what we want to modify, some particles are placed *after*.
### Marker particles
- `o` denotes the direct object; it is the "direct object" marker
- `e` the closest to the **vocative** case. Saying `e X` is equivelant to "hey X!". It can also be used in the place of `wa` to change the predicate into a **command**.
- `wa` is the subject/topic marker. For instance, `A wa B` means "Because/in the context of A, B". Most sentences of ours will be constructed this way.
- `wi` links two verbs. Think of `taneru wi taweru` as meaning roughly taneru *in order to* taweru. Again, the usage of this must be **highly dependent** on the meaning of the verbs. A great example of `wi` would be linking *to try to*(`paweru`) with `taweru`, which would mean something like "try to move". 
#### The particle `na` 
It is the negation particle and denotes "not". Usually coming after the word it intends to modify(even prepositions can have a `na`). For example in 
-  mi wi ru **na**  o ni. (I am **not** doing that)
#### The particles `ne` and `nu` 
It links subjects and/or objects, **but not verbs**. Functioning like the english `and`. For example,
- `mi ne si wa ruka taweru o tomo` = "me and you are going to the house"
Meanwhile, `nu` functions like `or`, seperating the multiple possibilities.
#### The particle `jo` 
`jo` roughly translates to "own, possess, have"; As the *posessive* particle, it means "owned" or "possessed (by)", indicating ownership of what comes before it by what comes after it. Since this tokiponedo is using a head-initial order, `jo` modifies a verb to clarify posession, and then any further modification becomes the *recipient* of the posession. Aka, the "owner". For example,
- `ijo ni jo mi` = "This thing is mine".
- `tomo jo Anjo` = "Anjo's house"
#### The particle `ni` 
It is analogous to "this", "that"; It is the **demonstrative particle**.  Out of all particles discussed, it is important to understand that `ni` is used for various purposes
- as a "that/this/there/those" (`jan ni seme?)` = "who is it".
- to demonstrate emphasis, like saying "this thing here" (`ijo ni`)
### Questions
`seme` forms questions. you replace the word which you seek inquiry for.
- `nimi si wa seme?` = "your name is what?" = "What is your name?"
- `si wa ru seme?` = "you're doing what?" (**ru is the verb meaning "to do"**)
- `seme wa Anjo` = "what(subject) is Anjo?" = "Who's Anjo?" 
- `jan nimi wa seme?` = "person's name is what?" = "what is their name" ?
### Recursion
Recursion is a bit tricky; and will be discussed once i update this text. For now I advice simply closing your sentences and using anaphora or the demonstrative particle to refer to something in another sentence. For example, "I will move to the house that has no doors" could be:
`mi wa taweru o tomo. tomo ni wa ron na poruta`. You could also say it in the inverse order.
`mi wa taweru o tomo. poruta wa ron na tomo ni `. But the order depends on what you want to express.
This is also a moment to take a minute and describe how `wa` can also mean "has". By using `wa`, we're simply implying a relationship between the subject and the predicate. The second sentence literally means "in the context of this house, there (exist) no doors".  Of course 'exist' is implied, ron mostly means *present*
## Prepositions
Prepositions are used to further describe the *manner* of the predicate. They indicate information about where, whither, whence, how, or whereby the predicate is performed.
### The preposition `tawa`
Being a derivative of `taweru`(to move) it describes movement towards a specific object or person. For example,
- `mi wi taweru o ijo tawa si` = "I am moving the thing **towards** you"
- `ijo wi tawa si` = "the thing is moving **towards** you".
- `ijo wi taweru tawa seme` = literally: the thing moving towards what? = "what is it moving towards?".

Notice how, if we were to introduce `o` the meaning would change:
- `ijo wi taweru o seme?` = "it is moving the what?" = "What is it moving?"
- `ijo wi taweru o ni tawa seme` = "it is moving the **this** towards what?".  After all, ni can also refer to "this/that" like we saw.

Remember: This would have a completely different meaning if we said `ijo wi taweru o si`. As that would mean "the thing is moving **you**". This is because `o` marks the direct object(the recipient of the action).
Therefore, the exact meaning of `tawa` depends on its usage.
### The preposition `iwa`
Being a derivative of `iwo`, it describes the usage. It is analogous to saying "using" in English but with a different twist. For the toki-ponists, this is `kepeken`. For instance:
- `awejan taweru o si iwa suko` = "They're moving you using a mushroom".
- `awejan taweru o ijo ni tawa si iwa suko` = "They're moving this thing towards you using a mushroom".
- `awejan taweru iwa seme?` = "What are they moving with?". This question specifically asks which is the method of movement, or roughly the vehicle
### The preposition `tana`
Being a derivative of `tan`, it means to originate from. It it similarly used to the toki pona equivelant `tan`. For instance:
- `awejan wa tana inli` = "they are from england".
### The preposition `ron` 
It roughly translates into "into at". It’s a locative particle that marks *both* space and time. In other words, it can refer to a specific place **in space** or a specific moment **in time**. For example,
- `mi ne si wa ron tomo` = "me and you (are/at) the house." 
- `mi wa ru na ron tenpo ni` = "I'm not doing anything right now"
- `mi wa tokeru o awejan ron tomo` = "I am speaking to them in the house"

Like we discussed earlier, and particularly visible in the first sentence, you do not need to state that the subject(`mi ne si`) "is". `wa` means roughly "in the context of" or "about". Here, it means something more like "about, existing/thus,". Putting it all together the first sentence is more directly translated to: "About me and you, thus existing, on the house". It is a faster way to convey the more general translation that is provided. Another example of how `na` could be used in conjuction with the preposition is:
- `mi wa tokeru o awejan tawa Anjo sama na Koto` = "I am speaking about them to Anjo, in the manner, unlike Koto".
### The preposition `sama` -- A-like B.
`sama` means similarity, and therefore, using it implies that the **predicate** is similar to something. Like we discussed earlier, prepositions describe the *manner* of the predicate. Let's look at an example:
- `Anjo wa tokeru o A ni sama mi` = "Anjo is speaking of (this) A like me.".
- `Anjo wa sama mi` = "Anjo is like me"
In classic toki pona speech, the `wa` wouldn't be put as their equivelant clarifies the verb of the predicate. However, `wa` here is more general: implying the context(sometimes casual sometimes not). If you're familiar with other languages, it is  *sort of* like the topic marker in Japaense; in the sense that it can also imply the subject.
### Expressions and Customs
- `ron najo` = literally "present in nothing". For instance this can be used to describe actions **in vain**(notice how similar this expression is in english too.)
- `ron tenpo ni` = "present in current time" ("this" time)
- `e jan awi!` = 'hey everyone'.
- `A wa sama B` = `A is like B`, where A is the context. Here sama functions as an **adjective** rather than noun. And the sentence most accurately translates to: `me-like B`.
